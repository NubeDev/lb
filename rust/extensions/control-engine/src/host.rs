//! `HostCtx` — the CE sidecar's one handle to the host: the `lb-sidecar-client` callback transport
//! plus the sidecar's own parsed grant (its `LB_EXT_TOKEN` caps + workspace). Two jobs, both
//! host-mediated (the ROS-sidecar idiom, reused verbatim — control-engine scope §"caps"):
//!
//! 1. **Per-verb capability self-check** (`require`). The inbound path to a native sidecar tool is the
//!    host's `native.call` verb, gated only by `mcp:native.call:call` — the control line carries NO
//!    caller principal/caps. So the finer `mcp:control-engine.appliance.add:call` etc. granularity the
//!    scope demands is enforced HERE, by the handler, against the sidecar's own grant (`requested ∩
//!    admin_approved`, a node-signed JWT the host already verified to mint). Read with
//!    `claims_unverified` (no key needed — the host verified it at inject; the child cannot forge a
//!    grant it was not given).
//!
//! 2. **Host callbacks** (`client`). The `ce_appliance` registry CRUD reaches the store through the one
//!    `SidecarClient`: `store.write` (add), `store.query` (list/resolve), `store.delete` (remove) —
//!    each denied identically by the host's capability + workspace gate (a `403` → `CallError::Denied`).
//!
//! **Workspace isolation is structural, not a per-call arg.** The sidecar is spawned per-(ws,ext_id)
//! with a fixed `LB_EXT_WS`; every callback authenticates with the ws-scoped token, so a ws-A sidecar
//! can never read/write ws-B — the wall is the token, not anything a handler passes (§7).
//!
//! **Local-vs-remote is the HOST's job, not this sidecar's (symmetric nodes, §3.1).** The sidecar
//! never opens a Zenoh session and never decides "route elsewhere": any `control-engine.*` call that
//! REACHES it is for an appliance this node owns, because the host router forwarded it to the owning
//! node (the existing routed-MCP hop, by ext id). So `resolve.rs` reads the `ce_appliance` record only
//! to recover the CE **base** to connect to locally; a record absent in this workspace is a clean
//! not-found (the isolation wall). The record's `node` field is recorded for the registry listing +
//! a future discovery layer that populates the remote-routing entry — the sidecar does not branch on it.
