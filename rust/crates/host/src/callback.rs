//! The host-callback bridge: the `lb-runtime` [`HostBridge`] seam implemented over the host's
//! `call_tool` chokepoint (host-callback scope).
//!
//! When the host runs a wasm guest under a caller's identity, it installs a [`Bridge`] into the
//! instance's `HostState`. The guest's `host.call-tool` import dispatches through it — re-entering
//! the SAME `lb_host::call_tool` the page bridge and the gateway reach, so a guest-initiated call is
//! authorized and workspace-checked identically to any other. The bridge carries:
//!   - an `Arc<Node>` (to reach the store/registry/bus the dispatch needs),
//!   - the guest's **effective principal** = `caller ∩ install-grant` (set by the caller, never
//!     widened — see [`super::tool_call`]),
//!   - the workspace (host-set, never guest-supplied),
//! so the callback acts on behalf of the caller AND within the install grant, in the caller's ws.
//!
//! **Borrow discipline (the re-entrancy hazard).** The callback dispatches through `call_tool`,
//! which resolves a FRESH target (instance/route) and locks it — it never re-borrows the in-flight
//! `&mut Instance` whose guest is mid-call. A guest that calls its OWN tool recurses through a fresh
//! lock acquisition; the depth guard (a fixed limit) bounds it before a stack blow-up or a deadlock.
