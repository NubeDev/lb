//! The outbox **effect** record — one normalized must-deliver intent every target collapses into
//! (README §6.10, outbox scope "the record shape").
//!
//! An effect is *state*: it lives in the store at `outbox:{id}` within a workspace, so a
//! must-deliver intent (open a PR, post a comment, notify, sync-publish) survives a crash and an
//! outage. `idempotency_key` is the contract with the receiver: it dedups on this, so the relay's
//! at-least-once retry never double-sends (outbox scope). `ts` is a caller-injected logical
//! timestamp (testing §3 — no wall-clock inside the crate).
