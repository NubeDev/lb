//! Scan a workspace's **schedulable** effects — the relay's durable backstop (outbox scope).
//!
//! "Schedulable" = not yet `Delivered`: both `Pending` (never tried) and `Failed` (tried, still
//! owed). A LIVE query gives instant pickup, but it is ephemeral (§6.2) — this durable scan is the
//! source of truth, so a relay that restarts simply re-reads the same set and an effect that
//! crashed mid-delivery is found again (never lost). The namespace is selected from `ws`, so a
//! ws-B scan can physically only return ws-B effects (the hard wall, §7).
//!
//! The generic store `list` is a pure equality filter (it does not order — see
//! debugging/store/order-by-needs-selected-idiom.md), so this verb runs the two undelivered statuses
//! and merges them, ordering by the logical `ts` itself (deterministic — `ts` is injected, §3).
//!
//! Two reads on this set:
//!   - [`pending`] — every *schedulable* effect (pending or failed), regardless of backoff. The
//!     audit/observability view and what the existing tests assert on. A `DeadLettered` effect is
//!     terminal and never appears here.
//!   - [`due`] — the subset whose `next_attempt_ts <= now`: what the relay should actually attempt
//!     this pass. This is the backoff gate — a recently-failed effect is still `pending` (owed) but
//!     not yet `due` (waiting out its backoff).
//!
//! Plus [`dead_lettered`] — the parked poison messages, for an operator to inspect / replay.
