//! Open an embedded SurrealDB. Two engines are compiled into **every** node: `Mem` (in-memory,
//! for tests/dev — [`Store::memory`]) and `SurrealKv` (persistent on-disk — [`Store::open`]).
//! Which constructor a node calls is a **config** decision at boot (`LB_STORE_PATH`), never a
//! code branch on role (symmetric nodes, rule #1). The handle type is identical for both, so
//! every read/write/list/write_tx caller is unchanged above this seam.
//!
//! The persistent engine is **SurrealKV** (pinned by the S9 store spike: pure-Rust, no C++
//! toolchain, the "builds anywhere / on a Pi" posture; durability across restart and the
//! LOAD-BEARING feature set verified — see `docs/scope/store/persistent-backend-scope.md`).
