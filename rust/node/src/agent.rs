//! The node's **in-house agent** wiring (default-agent-wiring scope) — the thin role-aware boot layer
//! (§3.1) that finishes the always-present `"default"` runtime: it builds the in-house model from node
//! config, installs it on the runtime registry, and serves the agent to routed callers. Like
//! `federation.rs` / `control_engine.rs`, no core crate is role-aware; the config-keyed decision lives
//! here in the binary, never an `if cloud`.
//!
//! Two steps, both symmetric (config only, same code on every node):
//!
//! 1. **Wire the model.** From env config (`LB_AGENT_MODEL_*`, mirroring the `ModelEndpoint` shape:
//!    provider / model / api-key-env NAME / base-url), build the real `AiGateway<Provider>` as the
//!    node's [`lb_host::ModelAccess`] and install it via [`lb_host::Node::install_runtimes`], so the
//!    in-house `default` binds the real model instead of [`lb_host::UnconfiguredModel`]. **No model
//!    configured → keep `UnconfiguredModel`** (the honest empty state, not a fake). The API key is an
//!    env NAME resolved through the provider adapter's secrets path — never compiled in or logged.
//!
//! 2. **Serve it.** Build the registry (in-house default over the wired model + the external
//!    `AcpRuntime` entries when the `external-agent` feature is on) and call
//!    [`lb_host::serve_agent`], so a routed `agent.invoke` reaches the finished agent. Mounted from
//!    `main.rs` AFTER the gateway installs its signing key (the same ordering federation/control-engine
//!    use), so the served run's tool callbacks verify.
//!
//! **The real adapter is wired (active-agent-wiring scope).** [`adapter_for`] maps the catalog's
//! providers (`zaicoding`, `openai`, the generic `openai-compat`) to a real `AiGateway<OpenAiCompat>`
//! — the OpenAI chat-completions wire shape. Both the node-level in-house fallback
//! ([`build_in_house_model`]) and the per-workspace [`NodeModelBuilder`] route through it, so "the
//! node's default model" and "a workspace's picked model" never diverge on which providers are real.
//! An unknown provider still keeps `UnconfiguredModel` (the honest empty state). The
//! unconfigured→configured **swap** is proven for real against `MockProvider` at the test boundary
//! (`crates/host/tests/agent_in_house_wiring_test.rs`); the OpenAI-compat adapter itself is tested
//! against a scripted in-process server (`role/ai-gateway/tests/openai_compat_test.rs`).
