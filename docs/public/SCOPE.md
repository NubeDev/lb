# Project scope (as built)

The trimmed source of truth for what exists now. The full architecture spec is the root
`README.md`; the staged plan is `../STAGES.md`; live status is `../STATUS.md`.

## Shipped (S2 — first app: messaging + UI + hot-reload)

A vertical slice through every layer, on top of the S1 spine:

- **Bus** — Zenoh pub/sub (`publish`/`subscribe`) + **presence** via liveliness tokens, all
  workspace-scoped (`ws/{id}/chan/{cid}/**`). See `bus/bus.md`.
- **Inbox** — a normalized `Item` model persisted to SurrealDB; idempotent on `(channel,id)`,
  ordered by `ts`. See `inbox-outbox/inbox-outbox.md`.
- **Channels (state vs motion)** — the host `channel` service: post → `caps::check` → **persist
  (store) then publish (bus)**; history reads the durable record. The capability chokepoint for
  messaging (`bus:chan/{cid}:{pub|sub}`).
- **Store** — added a workspace-scoped `list` filter verb. See `store/store.md`.
- **UI** — a React + Tailwind **channel view** in a Tauri v2 shell, talking to the in-process
  node over IPC; the api client mirrors the Rust verbs. See `frontend/frontend.md`.
- **Hot-reload** — `reload_extension` swaps a live component (hello v1→v2) with **no durable
  state lost** (the stateless-extension guarantee).

**Exit gate met.** Post a message in the UI and it appears (Vitest); history survives independent
of the bus / a restart (the store keeps it); an extension version swaps live with state intact.
54 Rust tests + 6 Vitest + 2 shell tests pass — incl. the mandatory capability-deny,
workspace-isolation (bus+store+inbox), and hot-reload categories.

## Shipped (S0 + S1 — the spine)

A single Rust binary (`node`) built from a Cargo workspace, running a **solo node** that
proves the capability model end to end:

- **Workspace** (`rust/`) — the §9 crate split: real `host store bus runtime mcp auth caps
  ext-loader`, plus stubs for `tags inbox jobs secrets sync` and placeholder `role/*` crates.
  See `crate-layout/crate-layout.md`.
- **Stable extension ABI** — a WASI 0.2 Component-Model world in `sdk/wit/world.wit`
  (`lazybones:ext/extension@0.1.0`), versioned; host + guest generated from the one file.
- **Capabilities** — `<surface>:<resource>:<action>` grammar; an Ed25519 JWT with a single
  `ws` claim; a two-gate check (workspace-first, then capability) as the single chokepoint.
  See `auth-caps/auth-caps.md`.
- **MCP** — `call → authorize → resolve → dispatch`; authorize before resolve so denials don't
  leak tool existence. See `mcp/mcp.md`.
- **Store** — embedded SurrealDB, workspace = namespace (isolation is structural).
- **Bus** — embedded Zenoh peer + workspace key prefixing (pub/sub at S2).
- **Runtime** — wasmtime component host; loads `extensions/hello` and answers `hello.echo`.
- **CI** — FILE-LAYOUT size check + build (incl. the wasm guest) + test + fmt.

**Exit gates met.** S0: `cargo build` green; CI runs; manifest + capability grammar written as
scope docs. S1: tool call refused without the grant / allowed with it; cross-workspace data is
invisible. 35 tests pass (mandatory capability-deny + workspace-isolation included).

## The four forever decisions (resolved in S0)

| Decision | Choice | Where |
|---|---|---|
| SDK/WIT boundary | WASI 0.2 Component-Model world, semver-versioned | `crate-layout/` |
| Capability grammar + token | `surface:resource:action` + Ed25519 JWT, two-gate check | `auth-caps/` |
| Job queue | thin **native** SurrealDB queue (not apalis), built at S5 | `../scope/jobs/` |
| Extension manifest | **TOML** `extension.toml`; host grants `requested ∩ approved` | `../scope/extensions/` |

## Not yet built

Multi-node / sync / SSE browser path (S3); shared assets (S4); AI core (S5); coding workflow
(S6); registry + native tier (S7). The transactional must-deliver **outbox** and bus message
classification wait for a second node. Tracked in `../STATUS.md` and `../STAGES.md`.
